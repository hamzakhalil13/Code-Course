# Code-Course
Designed and built a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL


Starting with this project was a bit difficult and it wasn’t the coding part that was
difficult more of the idea. I’ve always wanted to be able to sell or provide some sort of
service of my own. Something that I’ve always wanted to do and I was able to pour that
imagination into this project. The goal of this project is to create a website that provides
online courses for people interested in learning how to code. Starting to learn how to code
can be very intimidating and difficult. That is why I created a friendly user website that
gives users a nice experience while browsing through the website. Both the images and
colors used give a nice tech aesthetics.
There was a lot of difficulty and challenges I faced while trying to create and
finalize this project. In general the most difficult part of this project was creating the main
web page. It was difficult just to start. When I started I didn’t know how I was going to
design my webpage let alone how I was going to make it. I started off with taking an
easier approach by creating a form just so I can get more comfortable with what I’m
doing. After finalizing my log in form I had many ideas brewing in my head about how
my main page would look. Its outstanding how every small detail matters when it comes
to creating a website. That’s what make it even more difficult. Planning the structure is
where I started with the use of HTML. I created a layout on how I wanted my website to
be and look. Once the layout was set in place I was able to begin coding everything. It
made it a lot easier with the use of the layout. As I went along with creating my main
page I always had an idea of how I wanted to look with the help of the structure I
designed. Another crucial part that made it difficult was designing the page with the use
of CSS. I believe that it is more complicated to design the webpage than writing
everything out in HTML. With HTML you are just creating tags and writing out what
they’re supposed to be and then they all get aligned on their own in the webpage. With
the design you have to set your own parameters on how you want each little part of your
website to look. I put in a lot of research on different attributes and how they work just to
have everything exactly as I want it. There are a lot of different attributes that can be used
to help design your webpage and it was a real struggle learning as much as I could. It
was very tough playing around with different measurements of attributes like width,
height, margin, and padding. I consistently had to play around with these measurements
to get the placement that best suited my website. Another difficult part of this project was
adding java scrip to my sign up and log in page. I implanted an event that allows users to
see the password they input to create an account. At first I created a checkbox and an
onclick attribute that calls onto my function to show the password. What the function
does is that it receives the id attached to the password input and checks if the input is a
password. If it is a password than it converts it into a type text and if it is not than it
ignores that. All of this is done with the click of the checkbox. Another difficulty I faced
in this project is the use of JavaScript to add a counter for characters the user uses to send
a message. In that text area I set a limit on the length of characters used. It was easy to
setup using the maxlength attribute. To go along with that I set a character counter that
shows the user how many characters they used using JavaScript. In the function I retrieve
the ID of the input and use its value to set the length of characters the user uses. I also
have a limit variable placed at 200 characters. After the user begins inputting characters
my function starts adding up the amount of characters being used and displays it to the
user. The most interesting part of my project is in the sign up page. I had a difficulty
when users would input wrong information. The webpage would go through regardless of
what the user entered. Finally I was able to write some code in a PHP file that directed
the user to an error page if the information was incorrect. If the information the user
added was valid than it would be stored in the database successfully.
My pages interact with one another very well. It starts with the home page where
the user first enters and gets a good sight of the webpage. In the top right corner I set
links the user can access to be directed to other pages. It includes a home, contact, about,
log in, and sign up links. Also throughout the main page I have other button set up so the
user can also access these other pages as well. There are also links present in every page
that directs the user back to the home page. I also created a database that stores the user’s
message they wish to send to us. Once the user is directed to the contact page there is a
form set for them to fill out. After the form is completed and they click on the submit
button. All that information is accessed by a PHP file that connects to the data base I
made. It stores all their information and responds with a message that their submission
was sent successfully. Similar to this process, I also added more back end features with
the sign up page. Once a new user visits the webpage and decides to create an account,
they will be able to do so if the information they submitted is correct. The sign up form is
also linked with a PHP file that retrieves the user’s information and is stored in a
database. In the PHP file I wrote code that will direct the user to an error page if the
information they inputted was incorrect, but if the information was valid it goes through
to the database. The databases are connected to this webpage with the help of PHP. I am
able to have the database linked to my HTML pages because of the code used in a PHP
file and the use of MySQL. It is an outstanding relationship these languages have with
each other. They all rely one each other to make sure one goal is reached. HTML used for
the structure, CSS used for the amazing designs, JavaScript for the dynamic of the site,
PHP serves as the middle man and retrieves the info to the server, and finally MySQL
storing all the information in its databases.
